# Botwheels
This project combines an Arduino-based Bluetooth-controlled car with a chatbot interface for controlling the car remotely. With this setup, users can interact with the car using simple chat commands via a messaging platform while enjoying the flexibility of remote control.

## Features
#### Arduino Bluetooth Car:
Wireless Control: The car can be controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth communication from a mobile device or computer.
Directional Movement: Users can move the car forwards, backward, left, and right using directional commands.
Customizable: The Arduino code is easily customizable to add additional features such as speed control, obstacle avoidance, or sensor integration.
#### Chatbot Interface:
Conversational Control: Users can interact with the car using natural language commands via a chatbot interface.
Remote Operation: The chatbot interface allows users to control the car from anywhere with an internet connection.
Integration: The chatbot can be integrated with popular messaging platforms such as Telegram, Discord, or Facebook Messenger.
